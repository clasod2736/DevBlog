# Deploying Static web-site(Next.js) on AWS S3 & Cloudfront with custom domain. (Route53)

#### First serverless experience

## 1. Set up S3

1. Set region near you and bucket name.
2. Check object ownership to <u><strong style={{color:'yellow'}}>ACLs disabled(recommended)</strong></u>

3. Block all public access

   <img
     src={
       '/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/bucket public access.jpg'
     }
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'bucket1'}
   />

4. Go to "Property" category edit "Static web hosting" section
   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/bucket2.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'bucket2'}
   />
   Check the boxes like image and put "index/html" for both documents in input and
   press "Save"{' '}
5. Upload objects of your web-app
   If you built web-app in Next.js you need to set a few config in next.config.js file =><u><strong style={{color:'yellow'}}>for next.js "13.5.4" version</strong></u>

```
// basic next.config.js codes you need to add  "output: 'export'" property

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
}

module.exports = nextConfig

//and add a "deploy" command in your package.json file like this
"scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "deploy": "next build && next export",
  }
```

6. Then now time to go to connect Cloudfront.

## 2. Cloudfront

1. Create Distribution with basic setting.

   - Choose orgiin domain that appear automatically in dropdown as S3 endpoint.

2. Cache behavior section.

   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/cloudfront1.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'cloudfront1'}
   />
   Make sure you check "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS" and CachingOptimazed in Cache policy.
   Rest of setting keep default and press "Create distribution"

3. Set HTTPS with SSL certificates.
   Go to general category in the distribution that you just create.
   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/cloudfront2.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'cloudfront2'}
   />
   and add your custom domain like "example.com" and "*.example.com" as well and
   click request certificate button check public certi, and add the same 2 domains
   and check <b>DNS validation</b>
   <b style={{ color: 'yellow' }}>
     <u>You must set your "Region" to us-east-1 (N.Virginia)!!</u>
   </b>
   and press request, it will take around 10min ~ hour to validate the
   certificate. once you got certificate set the option lie upon image.
4. Origin setting.
   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/cloudfront3.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'cloudfront3'}
   />
   In origin category you can select origin S3 domain, but don't put the website
   endpoint because we weill use OAC in this case. press <b>Create new OAC</b> and
   make OAC with sign requests. once you set OAC click "copy policy" and go back
   to S3 Policy and paste the policies.

```
{
	"Version": "2008-10-17",
	"Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
			},
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[Your S3 bucket name]/*",
			"Condition": {
				"StringEquals": {
					"AWS:SourceArn": [Your Cloudfront ID]
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

This is how your policy will be, then you finished you origin setting.

5. Error pages setting.
   Go to Error pages category in distribution, click "create custom response" button.
   Make custom error page for 403 & 404 error like image below.
   {' '}
   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/cloudfront4.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'cloudfront4'}
   />

---

## 3. Connect custom domain in Route53 & ACM

1. Go to Route53 create hosted zone.
   Put custom domain you will use and check "Public hosted zone" and "Create hosted zone"

2. Add name-server values in your domain platform.
   Inside of hosted zone page you wil see the record that has <b style={{color:'yellow'}}>"NS"</b> then copy those 4 values and add in your domain platform.

3. Create record type "A"

   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/cloudfront6.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'cloudfront6'}
   />
   Set type "A" and toggle "Alias" and Route traffic to Cloudfront distribution,
   then you will see your distribution domain.

4. Go to ACM service and click your certificate for your cloudfront distribution.
   <img
     src={'/images/posts/Deploying S3 & Cloudfront on AWS/cloudfront5.png'}
     class="inline"
     style={{ height: 'auto', width: '100%' }}
     alt={'cloudfront5'}
   />
   Press "Create records in Route 53" button and click "Create records" then added
   the CNAME type record in Route53 hosted zone. Finally you will have 4 records
   in Route53 types with "A", "NS", "SOA", "CNAME"

---

## 4. Build CD pipeline with Github Actions.

Make direction "/.github/workflows/main.yml" in your Next.js project root directory.
Set your code like below.

```
name: My App Name

on:
  push:
    branches: main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code.
        uses: actions/checkout@main
        with:
          ref: main

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm install

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: My App Name
        run: |
          npm run deploy

      - name: Deploy to S3
        run: aws s3 sync ./out s3://joondev.blog --delete

      - name: Invalidate CloudFront Cache
        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.AWS_DISTRIBUTION_ID }} --paths "/*"
```

So now if you push your github repository, Github actions automatically upload your "out" folder (which is like "build" folder in React)
and AWS will deploy your web-appliction.
