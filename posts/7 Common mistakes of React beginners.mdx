# 7 Common Mistakes of React beginners.

### Intro

> I remember the time when I learned React first time, back then I was just beginner who just learn basic of javascript with finished a simple todo list.  
> All the concepts of components, state, lifecycle and SPA are was "HUGE" to me I didn't know what I was doing with React while working on my frist side project. All I know is just make useState and setState with event handlers, and set useEffect with just pluging the hole name is "Infinite Loop".  
> Now I more understand what React does - when something happening on the screen(rendering components that I've made haha) such as Lifecycle, Virtual DOM, Fiber and etc.  
> After gaining a better understanding of React's fundamentals, then I could understand why I need to seek and study not just about making components with useState and useEffect, what are the strengths of SPA? and what do I need to care about for improving them?  
> This post starts from that point. I believe there are tons of way to do this, but I start from basics :)

## List of mistakes

1. Not generating "key props".
2. Inefficient folder structure.
3. Return null for components you don't want to render.
4. useEffect and dependency array.
5. Accessing state after changing it.
6. Memory leak by EventListener.
7. A fatty component.

## 1. Not generating "key props".

<code>Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.</code>

When we are implement <code>map</code> method for rendering lists we need to set "key" prop like below

```javascript
function ShoppingList({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, "unique id") => {
        return <li key={unique id}>{item}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

#### Why?

> React identify list elements with "Key" value, if we haven't set key props and order of lists is changed.
> Then React re-rendering whole list from the scratch with high potential, but if you set key props React will update only needed lists.
> It affects to performance. If you want to browse what is happening under the hood ,<br/> Go to this <a>https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists</a>

#### Wrapping up!

- Key props must be stable, predictable, and unique.
- Key props are just need to be unique inside of a node.

## 2. Inefficient folder structure.

<img

  alt="FolderStructure"
/>
<br />
The image is general case of folder structure in React.
<br />

- components: organizing all the components in each folder(my style is organizing by folder with pages name.)
- assets: images, svg, videos are in it.
- constants: some datas you want to export for rendering in your components.
- pages: page names.
- hooks: for custom hooks.
- store: for Redux
- styles: CSS files.
- types: types if you're using Typescript
- services: logical functions or utils.
- api: HTTP request
  {' '}
  <br />
  <br />
  and more...

#### Why?

Imagine, you've coded 100 components, pages, APIs, utils etc...and you created one folder "components" and put everything in it.<br/>
Then if you need to find some of random components or working with collaborators and it will be a problem.<br/>
Key points are scalability and maintainability, if your team has a good communication with folder strutures it could improve team performance.

#### Wrapping up!

- In terms of documentation, it is very basic way to improve your documentaion skill.
- Just remind when any type of file you create, think about purpose, usage, how readable it is.

## 3. Return null for components you don't want to render.

```javascript
function ListComponent({ items }) {
  if (items.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

<code>return null;</code> means you don't want to render anything, thus React won't
render children components as well. It is handy when you want to render specific
component conditionally, like upon image.

#### Why?

In my case, before I just added <code>style={{display: "none"}}</code> in corresponding component, but in this case corresponding components or elements actually rendered but just not appearing on the screen.<br/>
This is not React-like behavior also not readable and cause low performance.

#### Wrapping up!

- Also you could wrapp up whole component with <code><></></code> you don't want to add more html element in the DOM.

## 4. useEffect and dependency array.

<code>
  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: "???". Either include it or
  remove the dependency array react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
</code>

useEffect hook is set side-effects inside of components by a condition of dependency array.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('hello world!');
}, []);
```

Like upon codes if you set empty array as a dependency this useEffect will execute just once when component mounted.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  setState(true);
}, [state]);
```

And in this case, useEffect will activate only when state is changed.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  setState(true);
}, []);
```

<code>React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: "???"</code>
The error that I show you at below title come up with this.

#### Why?

Setting empty dependency aray means you have uncontrollable side-effects trigger in useEffect.
Some of the case will be okay and other may not, but at least we need to know which dependency cause errors.

#### Wrapping up!

- Be cautious to set too many of dependency in useEffect hook, it cause hard to handle and low performance.
- If you don't even put empty array, useEffect hook wil excute on every rendering and it is not good for performance.

## 5. Accessing state after changing it.

useState hook working asynchronously, see below codes.

```javascript
incrementCount() {
  // wrong code.
  this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1});
}

// expection value is 3, but result is 1.
handleSomething() {
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
}
```

#### Why?

if state is called in one event handler, update every state when after finished evet at once.

#### Wrapping up!

Do not make mistake like put console.log() and setState() inside of same functions anymore!

## 6. Memory leak by EventListener.

If you implementing EventListener function with useEffect in component, must remove that EventListener in <code>return () => {}</code> in same useEffect.
see below code.

```javascript
// This custom hook using Eventlistener for getting screen size
export const useScroll = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState < number > 0;
  const onScroll = () => {
    setState(window.scrollY);
  };
  useEffect(() => {
    // add Eventlistener
    window.addEventListener('scroll', onScroll);

    // remove Eventlistener
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', onScroll);
  }, []);
  return state;
};
```

#### Why?

Once render component with above custom hook, only EventListener keep only stacking in memory without removing.  
Then many EventListener doing same thing in same period when component redering and Ended up using unnecessary memory.

#### Wrapping up!

It is about memory problem, just don't forget clean up EventListener!.

## 7. A fatty component.

Fatty components, it means component that generating or implementing too many logics or features or datas.<br/>
See below codes.

```javascript
const TodosPage = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  // 1. Fetching data from API.
  useEffect(() => {
    async function getTodos() {
      const { data } = await axios.get(
        'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/'
      );
      const firstTen = data.slice(0, 10);
      setTodos(firstTen);
    }
    getTodos();
  }, []);

  // 2. Converting todo array into list of React elements.
  const renderTodos = () => {
    return todos.map((todo) => {
      return <li>{`ID: ${todo.id}, Title: ${todo.title}`}</li>;
    });
  };

  // 3. Structuring and displaying the todos.
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Todos:</h1>
      <ul>{renderTodos()}</ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Let's think about how many works on above component.

1. feching <code>todos</code> with API.
2. Generating lists with fetched <code>todos</code>
3. Showing lists to user.

I assume this component should only care about showing datas to user, too many logics in one component.  
For me, I would separate API in other folder and re-sedign that could be re-usable.  
Then make higher order component above this TodosPage component, set renderTodos function in there, passing datas with props to child component<br/>
and just remain the part of codes that showing datas in corresponding component.

#### Why?

If components too heavy or complex, it's hard to maintain and document also cause unnecessary re-rendering beacuse HOC getting fat as well.  
Besides it will make harder to code the tests.

#### Wrapping up!

The importance about splitting heavy component is mentioned in "S" of SOLID principle as well, which is "Single Responsiility Principle".  
Modulization of React components, set just one function or logic for each component and organize by your coding strategy or folder structure and etc.

## Summarization

I wrote about 7 mistakes of React beginners and I experienced those cases in my project with lots of errors haha
But eventually it helped to understand the nature of React, my application became more lean and flexible.
Hope this post could help somone like me studying React in beginner steps.
