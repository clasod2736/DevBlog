# CSS vs PostCSS vs SASS and...Tailwind.

##### Which one is the best CSS framework???

I would like to share my experiences and viewpoints on three popular CSS frameworks in my post that I have used. I have used these frameworks in various personal projects, and below are their pros and cons:

## Pure CSS

The pure CSS coding is not really "Hard" to use actually but the problem is it makes us to spend lots of time to organise html elements by name, improving maintainability and for high learning curve.

<br />
Yes, developers are could make powerful codes with pure CSS but if you think about
the productivity and time management, pure CSS may seems not a good option.
<br />
Thus, I believe those reasons why developers make feel pure CSS is difficult to use.

###### Pros

1. Easy to learn: But until only basic of CSS
2. Powerful: But only if you use like CSS "Master"
3. Lightweight: Comparably Lightweighted and fast-rendered than other CSS frameworks.

###### Cons

1. Maintenance: If projects are big, codes has to be well-organised.(structure)
2. Readability: We have naming rule the BEM but still not easy to learn than others.
3. Reusability: Pure CSS files cannot share their units each other, we need to write many of basic units repeatedly.

## SASS & SCSS

SASS & SCSS are "CSS Preprocessor" they provide advanced maintainability and readability so devs could make powerful and well-organised CSS structure with these.

<br />

##### What is the difference between SASS and SCSS?

Just little bit of grammars are different, examples below.

```sass
//SASS codes
.example
        width: 100px
        li
           color: blue
```

```scss
//SCSS codes
.example {
  width: 100px;
  li {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

For me, Im using SCSS because the I'm more familiar with SCSS grammars.

###### Perks of CSS preproccessors.

1. Import
2. Variables, Mixin
3. Nesting
4. if and for methods

```css
// import in SCSS & SASS
// We can import css units from another css files through import.
// Examples below

@import 'hello.css';
@import 'http://hello.com/hello';
@import url(hello);
@import 'hello' screen;
@import 'header', 'footer';

// Variable, Mixin
// Declare Variables insied of CSS file with "$" command
// Make custom style element with "@mixin"

//Variable
$main-color: 'red';

body {
  background-color: $main-color;
}

//Mixin
@mixin large-text {
  font: {
    size: 22px;
    weight: bold;
    family: sans-serif;
  }
  color: orange;

  &::after {
    content: '!!';
  }

  span.icon {
    background: url('/images/icon.png');
  }
}

h1 {
  @include large-text;
}
div {
  @include large-text;
}

// Nesting CSS units, it gives way better readability.

//css
nav ul {
  background-color: 'red';
}
nav li {
  color: 'white';
}
nav h4 {
  font-family: 'noto-sans';
}

//scss
nav {
  ul {
    background-color: 'red';
  }
  li {
    color: 'white';
  }
  h4 {
    font-family: 'noto-sans';
  }
}

// We could use "if" and "for" with variables in CSS file with SCSS & SASS

// If method
// set variable
$section-v1: 900px;
$section-v2: 500px;

.section-v1,
.section-v1 {
  height: 100px;
}

//use if method like in javascript
.section-v1 {
  width: $section-v1;
  @if ($section-v1 >= 700) {
    background-color: coral;
  } @else {
    background-color: orange;
  }
}
.section-v2 {
  width: $section-v2;
  @if ($section-v2 >= 700) {
    background-color: coral;
  } @else {
    background-color: orange;
  }
}

// You could add "and", "or", "not"
.section-v1 {
  width: $section-v1;
  @if $section-v1 >= 0 and $section-v1 <= 1000 {
    background-color: coral;
  } @else {
    background-color: orange;
  }
}

// For method
// When you want to set some repeating units.

// repeat from 1to 3
@for $i from 1 through 3 {
  .through:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) {
    width: 50px * $i;
  }
}

// repeat from 1to 2
@for $i from 1 to 3 {
  .to:nth-child(3n + #{$i}) {
    width: 50px * $i;
  }
}
```

###### Pros

1. Maintainability: Nesting and import functions are useful to improve readability and reusability.
2. Well-documented: SCSS & SASS is the most popular CSS framework of the world, research and communities are very active.
3. Dynamic CSS: Could manage CSS units dynamically with if and for methods.

###### Cons

1. Mixin: If you use "Mixin" too much, it could make lower performance because when compiling to CSS file; Mixin methods are more heavier than class unit.
2. Compiling: Browser cannot understand CSS preproccessor grammer, so need to compile everytime before run or deploy.

## PostCSS

##### What is PostCSS?

PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins.
So only PostCSS itself, it doesn't do any work actually. PostCSS has many useful plugin that help us to make powerful CSS.
For beginner, the best point is simplifying "className" in .jsx files with import "Styles" from "\*.module.css" file.
you could give the className "{styles.sampleClassName}" to highest element and write nested CSS code in modul css file. It's so cool!

```css
// Introduce most common plugins in PostCSS.

// autoprefixer
a {
  display: flex;
}
/* result */
a {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -webkit-flex;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
}

// postcss-import

/* foo.css */
.foo {
  width: 100px;
}
/* bar.css */
.bar {
  height: 20px;
}
/* index.css */
@import 'foo.css';
@import 'bar.css';
/* result of index.css */
.foo {
  width: 100px;
}
.bar {
  height: 20px;
}

// postcss-nesting
a,
b {
  color: red;
  & c,
  & d {
    color: white;
  }
  &:hover {
    color: black;
  }
  @nest div > & {
    color: blue;
  }
}
/* result */
a,
b {
  color: red;
}
a c,
a d,
b c,
b d {
  color: white;
}
a:hover,
b:hover {
  color: black;
}
div > a,
div > b {
  color: blue;
}

// postcss-assets
/* with loadPath settings */
body {
  background: resolve('bg.png');
}
.warn {
  width: width('warn.png'); /* calculate image size */
  background: resolve('warn.png');
}
/* result */
body {
  background: url('/images/bg.png');
}
.warn {
  width: 320px;
  background: url('/images/template/warn.png');
}
```

There are more than 100 plugins in PostCSS homepage, it could be much heavier than SCSS & SASS or tou just could use module.css form.
So the Key Point is "Customizing Plugins in your way"

###### Pros

1. Various Plugins: You could add most of the features of CSS and CSS frameworks as a plugin, isn't it flexible?
2. Module.css: As I mentioned before, you don't need to worry about making names of classes.
3. Customizing: Add Plugins in your taste and build your CSS coding style.

###### Cons

1. Customizing: This is a double edge of blade, too many plugins cause low productivity.
2. Support: There is potential for stopping support to certain plugin.

## Tailwind.css

Most recent and popular "Trend" in CSS world. Tailwind.css is a open source CSS framework, they provide fuction that user define css unit with className value<br/>
Unlike the other CSS framework they do not tend to provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.
They have all of the CSS units with slightly different names. Yes, you need to learn them but it won't be too hard.

```css
// Usage
<div className="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg flex items-center space-x-4">
  <div className="shrink-0">
    <img className="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo">
  </div>
  <div>
    <div className="text-xl font-medium text-black">ChitChat</div>
    <p className="text-slate-500">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>

// Advanced Usage
// Customize: You could customize most of the features color, animation, sizes etc in tailwind.config.js

const colors = require('tailwindcss/colors');

module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    colors: {
      transparent: 'transparent',
      current: 'currentColor',
      'white': '#ffffff',
      'purple': '#3f3cbb',
      'midnight': '#121063',
      'metal': '#565584',
      'tahiti': '#3ab7bf',
      'silver': '#ecebff',
      'bubble-gum': '#ff77e9',
      'bermuda': '#78dcca',
      'my-color': '#00FF7F',
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};

// Responsive Web
// tailwind.css provide preset screen size breakpoints, you could customize them; also you just could use in className.
// like "md:" "xs:"
<div className="flex flex-col md:max-w-[864px] xs:max-w-4xl">
    <MdxContent />
</div>

// Darkmode
// Easy to setup Darkmode with "dark:" prefix.

//setup in config file
module.exports = {
    darkMode: 'class',
// ... other configs
}

// write dark: in className
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-black dark:text-white">
<!-- contents -->
</div>

// It's a magic!!
```

###### Pros

1. Time saving: It's incredibly saves us time, once you get use to do this.
2. Presets: Responsive breakpoints, Darkmode, animations there are so many useful features provided.
3. Easy to learn: Well-documented web-doc, low learning curve.

###### Cons

Readability: In my opinion, this is the A to Z disadvantage of Tailwind.css. For high position element easy to have more than 10 CSS units in one className.

<br /> It is very hard to recognize each elements and components. Also bad for
documentation when co-working with team members in one project.
<br /> Solution could be study about folder structure and component structure if
you are using React.

## Overall Review

CSS has diverse way to improve their performance nad I am highly considering each frameworks has suitable environment and purpose.
For me, I'm gonna use Tailwind.css and PostCSS to my side project or small company project because of documentation.<br/>
But if I'm working in a big Project with many of developers, I'm definitely going to use CSS preprocessor.
Also This post reminds me studying basic of CSS and keep a close eye on updates is always important If you want to use them well.
